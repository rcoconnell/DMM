This Jupyter notebook uses a discrete mixing model to perform unsupervised clustering of profiles from an online freelance labor market called UpWork. Workers provide a list of their skills, and the learned clusters correspond to particular "types" of workers -- at a broad level, coders, web developers, designers, writers, and office workers. The dataset is described in more details in Anderson, Katharine A., (2018). “Skill Networks and Measures of Complex Human Capital” Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 201706597. A more complete description of the project is provided in the notebook.

I'm having trouble getting the Jupyter notebook to render nicely in GitHub, but you should be able to see it [using nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rcoconnell/DMM/blob/master/Discrete%20Mixing.ipynb). I've also put in some pre-rendered HTML, if you prefer.
